# stock_price_predictor
use ML to predict the market using past history


The goal is to use ML models to predict stock prices. 


I'll train different models with different parameters until I found the model with the highest accuracy (money making).

It'll be based on a scoring metric that I'm still deciding on.
Trying to see what will bring best results
